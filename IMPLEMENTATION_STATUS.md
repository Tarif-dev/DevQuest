## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:5000
```

### 2. Start Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
bun dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Test Flow

1. ✅ Visit http://localhost:3000
2. ✅ Click "Connect Wallet" in header
3. ✅ Connect your MetaMask wallet (Sepolia network)
4. ✅ Click "Explore Projects" to see projects page
5. ✅ Click "+ Create Project" button
6. ✅ Fill out the form and submit
7. ✅ Navigate to "Tasks" in header
8. ✅ Try filtering tasks
9. ✅ Click "Claim Task" (if tasks exist)
