# Web3 Provider Fixes - October 24, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ConnectKit Provider Error

**Error:** `ConnectKitProvider must be within a WagmiProvider`

**Root Cause:**

- Conflicting wallet libraries (RainbowKit, Web3Modal, and ConnectKit) installed simultaneously
- SSR hydration issues with Web3 provider configuration
- QueryClient being created outside component causing hydration mismatches

**Solutions Applied:**

- Removed conflicting libraries (`@rainbow-me/rainbowkit`, `@web3modal/wagmi`, `ethers`) from package.json
- Moved QueryClient creation inside component using useState hook to prevent SSR mismatches
- Removed `ssr: true` flag from ConnectKit config (not needed with proper setup)
- Added fallback for RPC URL to prevent undefined errors
- Made appUrl dynamic to work with window.location.origin

### 2. Default Wallet Status Error

**Error:** `Error checking default wallet status: {}`

**Root Cause:**

- MetaMask/wallet extension trying to check status before Web3 provider fully initialized
- Missing error handling in wallet connection

**Solutions Applied:**

- Config now created outside component to avoid recreation on each render
- Added proper fallbacks for environment variables
- Improved webpack configuration to handle node-specific modules

### 3. Monorepo Setup Issues

**Problems Found:**

- Multiple `bun.lockb` files in different workspaces (should only be one in root)
- No `bunfig.toml` for Bun workspace configuration
- Conflicting dependencies across workspaces
- Missing cleanup scripts for Windows

**Solutions Applied:**

- Created `bunfig.toml` with proper workspace configuration
- Added `MONOREPO_SETUP.md` with comprehensive setup instructions
- Created `clean.bat` script for easy cleanup on Windows
- Updated package.json scripts to use Windows-compatible commands
- Removed `install:all` script (not needed with proper workspace setup)

## Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/src/providers/web3-provider.tsx`

- Moved QueryClient to useState hook
- Removed `ssr: true` flag
- Added RPC URL fallback
- Made appUrl dynamic
- Removed unused imports

### 2. `frontend/next.config.ts`

- Added `reactStrictMode: true`
- Enhanced webpack config for Web3 compatibility
- Added node module aliases
- Added experimental package import optimization

### 3. `frontend/package.json`

- Removed `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit`
- Removed `@web3modal/wagmi`
- Removed `ethers` (using viem instead)
- Kept only ConnectKit for wallet connections

### 4. Root Directory

- Created `bunfig.toml` for Bun workspace management
- Created `MONOREPO_SETUP.md` for documentation
- Created `clean.bat` for Windows cleanup
- Updated root `package.json` scripts

## Next Steps to Apply Fixes

### Option 1: Quick Fix (If Server is Running)

1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. Delete the `.next` directory:
   ```cmd
   rmdir /s /q frontend\.next
   ```
3. Restart the dev server:
   ```cmd
   cd frontend
   bun run dev
   ```

### Option 2: Full Reinstall (Recommended)

1. Run the cleanup script:
   ```cmd
   clean.bat
   ```
2. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```cmd
   bun install
   ```
3. Start the dev server:
   ```cmd
   cd frontend
   bun run dev
   ```

## Verification

After applying fixes, verify:

1. ✅ No console errors about ConnectKitProvider
2. ✅ No wallet status errors in console
3. ✅ Wallet connection button appears and works
4. ✅ No hydration warnings in console
5. ✅ Only one `bun.lockb` file in root directory

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required env vars are set in `frontend/.env.local`
2. **WalletConnect Project ID**: Get a free ID from https://cloud.walletconnect.com
3. **RPC URL**: Consider using your own Alchemy/Infura key for better rate limits
4. **Browser Cache**: Clear browser cache and cookies for localhost if issues persist

## Technical Details

### Why These Fixes Work

1. **QueryClient in useState**: Prevents React hydration mismatches by ensuring client is created fresh on mount
2. **Config Outside Component**: Prevents unnecessary recreation of Wagmi config on each render
3. **Single Wallet Library**: Eliminates conflicts and reduces bundle size
4. **Proper Workspace Setup**: Ensures dependencies are properly hoisted and linked
5. **Enhanced Webpack Config**: Handles Web3 libraries' node dependencies correctly
